Major roads witness massive jams during peak hours. What used to be a 30-minute journey now takes over 2 hours. This affects:\n\n1. Students reaching schools late\n2. Office workers missing important meetings\n3. Emergency vehicles stuck in traffic\n4. Increased pollution levels\n5. Wastage of fuel and time\n\nReasons for this problem:\n- Increasing number of private vehicles\n- Poor road infrastructure\n- Inadequate public transport\n- Lack of traffic management\n- Illegal parking\n\nSuggested solutions:\n1. Improve public transport system\n2. Implement odd-even vehicle scheme\n3. Construct flyovers and underpasses\n4. Promote carpooling\n5. Strict action against traffic violations\n6. Encourage use of bicycles\n\nI hope the authorities will take immediate action to resolve this pressing issue.\n\nThank you.\n\nYours sincerely,\n[Your Name]\nClass X\nABC School",

    question_text_english: "Explain the theme of 'A Tiger in the Zoo' by Leslie Norris.",
    answer_text: "Theme of 'A Tiger in the Zoo':\n\nMain Themes:\n\n1. Freedom vs Captivity:\n- The poem contrasts the life of a tiger in a zoo with its natural habitat\n- In the jungle: free, powerful, fearless\n- In the zoo: confined, helpless, bored\n\n2. Loss of Natural Habitat:\n- Tigers belong to the wild\n- Forced to live in concrete cells\n- Unable to hunt or roam freely\n\n3. Human Cruelty:\n- Animals captured for entertainment\n- Kept in small cages\n- Natural instincts suppressed\n\n4. Silent Protest:\n- The tiger's quiet rage\n- Locked in a cage, stalking\n- Staring at stars - symbol of lost freedom\n\nPoetic Devices:\n\n1. Contrast:\n- \"Should be snarling around houses\" vs \"locked in a concrete cell\"\n\n2. Imagery:\n- \"Plump deer passes\" (natural prey)\n- \"Stares at the brilliant stars\" (longing for freedom)\n\n3. Personification:\n- Tiger has human emotions - anger, frustration\n\nMessage:\n- Animals should live in their natural habitat\n- Zoos are prisons for wild animals\n- Conservation should not mean captivity\n- Humans must respect wildlife\n\nThe poem makes us question whether keeping wild animals in zoos is justified, even in the name of protection and education.",
