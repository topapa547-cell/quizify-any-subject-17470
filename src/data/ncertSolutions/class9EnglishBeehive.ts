There is a crowd of worshippers, priests, animals, hawkers, devotees, tourists, and cows roaming around.

There are feathers and flowers scattered everywhere. The author also observes a small group of Westerners struggling to enter the temple but being stopped by a policeman because only Hindus are allowed inside. The atmosphere is noisy, crowded, and disorganized.",

    solution_text: "When it rains, the poet likes to lie in bed and listen to the patter of the soft rain on the roof.

The rain brings back fond memories of his mother and childhood. He loves to drift into pleasant dreams and recollections while listening to the rhythmic sound of the rain.",

When Saint Peter, who was hungry and faint, asked the old lady for a cake, she baked one but thought it was too large to give away. She then baked a smaller cake, but again thought it was too big. She continued making smaller and smaller cakes, but each time refused to give them to Saint Peter because she felt they were too large. Her extreme selfishness and lack of compassion angered Saint Peter. He cursed her, saying that she was too selfish to be a human being and deserved to be a bird that had to work hard for its food.

    solution_text: "According to the poem, a tree grows slowly and steadily over many years. It consumes nutrients from the earth, absorbs sunlight, air, and water. The tree's growth is a long process - it rises slowly from the earth's crust, feeding on nutrients from the soil. It develops its bark, leaves, and branches gradually. The tree grows by absorbing years of sunlight, air, and water. The poet emphasizes that a tree takes many years to grow and develop into a strong, mature plant with deep roots firmly anchored in the earth. This slow and patient growth makes the tree resilient and difficult to kill.",

    question_text_english: "What is required to kill a tree according to the poet?",
    solution_text: "According to the poet, killing a tree is not a simple task - it requires a deliberate and complete process. Simply hacking or chopping at the tree is not enough because it will heal and grow again. To completely kill a tree, one must uproot it entirely from the earth. The root, which is the source of the tree's life and strength, must be pulled out from the anchoring earth. The white and wet root, which has been hidden for years inside the earth, must be exposed to sunlight and air. Once exposed, the root will wither, dry up, and eventually die. The poet describes this as 'browning, hardening, twisting, withering'. Only through this complete uprooting and exposure of the roots can a tree be truly killed.",
