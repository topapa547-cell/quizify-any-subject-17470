    question_text: 'What does Mandela mean when he says that "every man has twin obligations"?',
    question_text_english: 'What does Mandela mean when he says that "every man has twin obligations"?',
    solution_text: 'When Mandela speaks of "twin obligations," he refers to two equally important duties that every person has:\n\nThe Two Obligations:\n\n1. Obligations to Family:\n- Duty towards parents, wife, and children\n- Providing for their needs and security\n- Ensuring their wellbeing and happiness\n- Being a responsible family member\n- Creating a safe and nurturing home environment\n\n2. Obligations to Community and Country:\n- Duty towards one\'s people, community, and nation\n- Fighting for justice and equality\n- Contributing to society\'s welfare\n- Working for the common good\n- Defending the rights and freedom of fellow citizens\n\nMandela\'s Personal Experience:\n\nIn South Africa under apartheid:\n- A black man could not fulfill even the first obligation (to family) because:\n  * He couldn\'t live with dignity\n  * He couldn\'t earn a proper living\n  * He couldn\'t provide security to his family\n  * He was denied basic human rights\n\n- When basic family obligations couldn\'t be met, he was forced to fulfill the second obligation (to community):\n  * To fight for freedom\n  * To challenge the unjust system\n  * To create a society where everyone could fulfill both obligations\n\nMandela\'s Conclusion:\n- In a civilized society, every person should be able to fulfill both obligations\n- Neither should be sacrificed for the other\n- In apartheid South Africa, the oppressive system made it impossible to fulfill either obligation properly\n- Therefore, he had to fight for freedom first, even at the cost of personal family life\n\nThis shows the deep conflict faced by freedom fighters who must sacrifice family for the larger cause of societal freedom.',
