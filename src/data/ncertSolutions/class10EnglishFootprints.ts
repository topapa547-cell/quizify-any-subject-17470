    question_text_english: 'Why is Mrs Pumphrey worried about Tricki?',
    solution_text: 'Mrs Pumphrey was deeply worried about Tricki, her little dog, because he had become seriously ill. She noticed several alarming symptoms:\n\n1. **Lack of energy**: Tricki had stopped playing and running around. He was listless and refused to go for walks.\n\n2. **Refusal to eat**: He refused even his favorite dishes and treats, which was very unusual for him.\n\n3. **Vomiting**: He had started vomiting, which indicated a serious digestive problem.\n\n4. **Physical appearance**: His eyes looked bloodshot and rheumy (watery).\n\nMrs Pumphrey couldn\'t bear to see her beloved pet in this condition. She was extremely fond of Tricki and treated him like her own child. She had been overfeeding him and giving him excessive treats, cream cakes, and chocolates between meals, which had made him grossly overweight. This overindulgence, combined with lack of exercise, had led to his poor health. Her worry stemmed from both genuine love for Tricki and guilt for having caused his condition through excessive pampering.',

    question_text_english: 'What does she do to help him? Is she wise in this?',
    solution_text: 'To help Tricki, Mrs Pumphrey took several actions, though not all of them were wise:\n\n**What she did:**\n1. Called the veterinary surgeon, Mr Herriot, for advice\n2. Gave Tricki extra food between meals (malt, cod-liver oil, Horlicks)\n3. Stopped his walks because she thought he looked "weak"\n4. Eventually agreed to hospitalize Tricki when his condition worsened\n\n**Was she wise?**\nNo, she was not wise in most of her actions:\n\n1. **Overfeeding**: Instead of reducing his food, she increased it by giving him extras like cream cakes, chocolates, and special treats. This made his condition worse.\n\n2. **Lack of exercise**: She stopped his walks thinking he looked weak, but this only contributed to his obesity and poor health.\n\n3. **Emotional response**: She treated Tricki like a spoiled child rather than understanding what he actually needed - discipline, proper diet, and exercise.\n\n4. **Ignoring advice**: She had been warned by Mr Herriot earlier to cut down Tricki\'s food and increase exercise, but she didn\'t follow this advice.\n\nThe only wise decision she made was finally agreeing to hospitalize Tricki when Mr Herriot insisted, even though it broke her heart to be separated from him.',

    question_text_english: 'Who does "I" refer to in this story? Why is the narrator tempted to keep Tricki on as a permanent guest?',
    solution_text: '**Who is "I":**\n"I" in this story refers to Mr Herriot, the veterinary surgeon who treats Tricki. He is the narrator of the story and tells it from his perspective.\n\n**Why tempted to keep Tricki permanently:**\n\nMr Herriot was tempted to keep Tricki as a permanent guest for several reasons:\n\n1. **Luxurious gifts**: Mrs Pumphrey sent a continuous stream of expensive gifts for Tricki - eggs, wine, brandy, and even fresh cream and cakes. These items were far beyond what Tricki needed or could consume.\n\n2. **Personal enjoyment**: Mr Herriot and his partners enjoyed these luxury items themselves. The eggs for breakfast, the wine and brandy before lunch and dinner made their lives much more comfortable and enjoyable.\n\n3. **Financial benefit**: These expensive supplies came at no cost to them, making it economically beneficial to keep Tricki.\n\n4. **Easy patient**: Tricki was recovering well through simple natural treatment (controlled diet and exercise), so he wasn\'t requiring any difficult medical interventions.\n\n5. **No effort needed**: The "treatment" mainly involved just letting Tricki run around with other dogs and controlling his food - very simple and effortless.\n\nThe phrase "a triumph of surgery" is actually humorous because no surgery was performed - just sensible diet and exercise!',

    question_text_english: 'Who does "I" refer to in this story? What is his profession?',
    solution_text: '**Who is "I":**\n"I" in this story refers to Hari Singh, a 15-year-old boy who is the narrator of the story. He tells the story from his own perspective.\n\n**His profession:**\nHari Singh is a thief by profession. However, he is not an ordinary thief:\n\n1. **Young age**: At just 15 years old, he has already become experienced in the art of theft.\n\n2. **Clever and cunning**: He knows how to win people\'s trust and then rob them. He is smart enough to use different names for each job.\n\n3. **Flattery expert**: He uses flattery as his main tool to gain entry into people\'s homes and win their confidence.\n\n4. **Changes identity**: He changes his name frequently - he has been called by many names before "Hari Singh." This helps him avoid getting caught.\n\n5. **Observant**: He carefully studies his victims and their routines before stealing.\n\nDespite being a thief, Hari Singh is not hardened or cruel. He is still young enough to have a conscience, which becomes evident later in the story when he feels guilty about betraying Anil\'s trust. His profession is more a result of circumstance and survival instinct rather than evil intent.',

    question_text_english: 'Why did Hari Singh approach Anil? What was his main purpose?',
    solution_text: 'Hari Singh approached Anil with a specific criminal intention:\n\n**Main Purpose:**\nHari Singh wanted to rob Anil. He was looking for a new victim to steal from, and Anil seemed like an easy target.\n\n**Why Anil:**\n\n1. **Simple and trusting**: Anil appeared to be a simple, easy-going person who could be easily fooled. He seemed gullible and trusting.\n\n2. **Lives alone**: Hari Singh observed that Anil lived alone, which would make it easier to steal without being caught.\n\n3. **Not very rich**: Anil was not very rich, which meant he wouldn\'t be very careful or suspicious about his money.\n\n4. **Kind-hearted**: Anil\'s kind and careless nature made him vulnerable to Hari Singh\'s flattery and manipulation.\n\n**Strategy:**\nHari Singh used his usual method - he flattered Anil by praising his wrestling skills and expressed a desire to work for him. His plan was to:\n1. Win Anil\'s trust\n2. Learn his routines and where he kept his money\n3. Steal the money when the opportunity arose\n4. Disappear\n\nHowever, Hari Singh didn\'t expect that living with Anil would change him and that Anil\'s trust and kindness would affect his conscience.',

He demonstrates that real intelligence work requires brains, not brawn. His ordinary appearance is actually an advantage - people underestimate him, making him more successful.',

    question_text_english: 'What does Horace Danby like to collect? How does he manage to do so?',
    solution_text: '**What Horace Danby collects:**\nHorace Danby loves to collect rare and expensive books. He is passionate about books and this is his main hobby.\n\n**How he manages to collect them:**\n\n1. **Robbery for books**: Since rare books are very expensive and Horace is not wealthy enough to afford them through honest means, he commits robberies once a year.\n\n2. **Annual theft**: He carefully plans and executes one burglary each year, stealing enough money or valuables to buy the rare books he desires.\n\n3. **Careful planning**: He is very meticulous in his planning. He studies houses for weeks, learns the routines of the occupants, and chooses the safest time to break in.\n\n4. **Skilled thief**: He has mastered lock-picking and other burglary techniques. He can open safes without any difficulty.\n\n5. **No violence**: He is a "good" thief in the sense that he never hurts anyone and only steals from wealthy people who are insured.\n\n6. **Legitimate business**: He also runs a legitimate locksmith business, which provides him with a cover and helps him study locks and security systems.\n\nIronically, his love for books - a noble passion - drives him to crime. This creates a moral dilemma: can we justify theft when it\'s done to pursue knowledge and culture? The story suggests that no matter how "gentlemanly" a thief may be, crime remains wrong.',

    question_text_english: 'How did the invisible man first become visible? Why did he become furious?',
    solution_text: '**How Griffin became visible:**\n\nGriffin first became visible when he was seen by two boys in London:\n\n1. **Muddy footprints**: He had stepped in mud, and as he walked, he left muddy footprints on the steps of a house in the middle of London.\n\n2. **Fresh footprints**: The boys saw fresh, muddy footprints appearing one after another, but no person was visible.\n\n3. **Followed the prints**: Fascinated and puzzled, the boys followed these mysterious footprints.\n\n4. **Discovery**: As they followed, they realized that the footprints were being made by someone invisible - they could see the impressions but not the person making them.\n\n**Why he became furious:**\n\nGriffin became furious for several reasons:\n\n1. **Loss of privacy**: His invisibility was his secret power, and being discovered, even partially, threatened his privacy and safety.\n\n2. **Being followed**: The boys were following him, which made him feel exposed and vulnerable.\n\n3. **His nature**: Griffin was an irritable, short-tempered person by nature. He easily became angry.\n\n4. **Fear of capture**: He was worried that if people discovered his presence, they might try to capture or harm him.\n\n5. **Lawless character**: He was a lawless person who had already committed crimes. Any attention was dangerous for him.\n\nThis incident shows that even with the power of invisibility, Griffin couldn\'t escape completely. Small mistakes like stepping in mud could expose him.',
