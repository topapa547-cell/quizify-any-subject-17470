    solution_text: "On his way to the fair, the child sees many fascinating things. He sees toys at the shops, beautiful insects and flowers in the mustard fields, dragonflies, butterflies, colorful balloons, a snake charmer playing a flute, and a roundabout swing. The child lags behind because he is attracted to all these things and wants to stop and observe them. His innocent curiosity makes him pause at each attraction. However, he knows his parents won't buy him these things, so he doesn't ask for them and just admires them from a distance before hurrying to catch up with his parents.",

He felt utterly helpless and frightened. His tears flowed continuously as he screamed for his mother and father. The child was overwhelmed with fear and anxiety.

Despite being offered all the things he had wanted earlier - toys, balloons, sweets, flowers, and even a ride on the roundabout - the child refused everything. This demonstrates that material things meant nothing to him without his parents. His only desire was to be reunited with his mother and father.

    question_text_english: "How did Olga save Lushkoff's life?",
    solution_text: "Olga, Sergei's cook, saved Lushkoff's life through her compassion, kindness, and silent efforts. While Sergei gave Lushkoff work chopping wood, it was actually Olga who did all the work herself because Lushkoff was too weak and unwilling to work. Despite scolding and rebuking him harshly for his drinking and laziness, she had a kind heart. She would weep for him and chop the wood herself out of sympathy. Her noble actions and genuine concern touched Lushkoff's heart and awakened his conscience. Her words and actions reformed him from within and inspired him to change his life. Later, when Lushkoff became a successful notary, he acknowledged that it was not Sergei's sermons but Olga's tears, kindness, and selfless actions that had transformed him and saved him from a life of begging and alcoholism.",
