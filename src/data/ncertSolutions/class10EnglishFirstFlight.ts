    solution_text: 'Lencho hoped for a good rain or at least a shower to water his fields of corn. He was a hardworking farmer who depended entirely on the harvest for his family\'s survival. The rain was essential for his crops, and he had been waiting anxiously for it. His fields needed water desperately, and he believed that a good rain would ensure a good harvest, which would help him feed his family and pay his debts.',

    question_text_english: 'Why did Lencho say the raindrops were like \'new coins\'?',
    solution_text: 'Lencho compared the raindrops to "new coins" because he saw them as a blessing that would bring him prosperity. As a farmer, rain meant that his crops would grow well, leading to a good harvest. A good harvest would bring him money when he sold his produce. Thus, the raindrops were as valuable as money to him. Each drop represented hope and the promise of financial security for his family. This metaphor beautifully captures how dependent farmers are on nature for their livelihood.',

    question_text_english: 'How did the rain change? What happened to Lencho\'s fields?',
    solution_text: 'The rain that Lencho had eagerly awaited suddenly changed into a hailstorm. What started as gentle raindrops turned into large hailstones that fell like frozen pearls. For an hour, the hail rained on the house, the garden, the hillside, and the cornfield. The hailstorm was devastating - it destroyed everything. The corn was completely ruined, the flowers were gone from the plants, and the trees were stripped bare. Not a single leaf remained on the trees. Lencho\'s fields, which had promised a good harvest, were completely destroyed, leaving the family facing starvation and ruin.',

    solution_text: 'When the hail stopped, Lencho was filled with sadness and despair. His soul was filled with sorrow as he looked at his ruined fields. He saw that his entire year\'s labor and hopes had been destroyed in just one hour. The corn that would have fed his family was gone. He was worried about his family\'s future - they would have no food to eat for the coming year. Despite this devastation, Lencho maintained his faith in God. He believed that God sees everything and would help them in their hour of need. This shows his deep religious faith and optimism even in the face of complete disaster.',

    solution_text: 'Lencho had unshakeable faith in God. He believed that God was all-knowing, all-seeing, and would never abandon those who truly believed in Him. Even after losing everything in the hailstorm, his faith remained strong.\n\nLencho decided to write a letter to God, asking for help. In the letter, he explained his situation - how the hailstorm had destroyed his fields and how his family would starve without money to buy food and seeds for replanting. He asked God to send him one hundred pesos to help him survive until the next harvest. He addressed the letter simply "To God" and put it in the mailbox, confident that it would reach its destination. This shows his simple, childlike faith and his belief that God would directly help him.',

The postmaster didn\'t want to shake this man\'s faith, so he decided to help.\n\nHe made a generous decision - he would answer the letter. However, he realized he couldn\'t send the full hundred pesos that Lencho had requested. So he called his employees and friends, explained the situation, and asked them to contribute. He himself gave part of his salary. Together, they collected seventy pesos. The postmaster put this money in an envelope addressed to Lencho and signed it simply "God" to maintain Lencho\'s faith. This act showed the postmaster\'s kindness, empathy, and understanding of the importance of faith in a person\'s life.',

He had written the letter with such confidence that he never doubted for a moment that God would respond to his request. His faith was so strong that he expected God to send him the money he had asked for.\n\nIn fact, Lencho showed no surprise whatsoever when he received the letter. He had been so certain of God\'s help that he was actually expecting the reply. However, when he opened the envelope and counted the money, he became angry because there were only seventy pesos instead of the hundred he had requested.

He called them "a bunch of crooks" in his second letter to God. This reaction shows the irony of the situation - the very people who helped him out of kindness were now being accused of theft.

He means:\n\n1. **Not alone**: He didn\'t achieve freedom for South Africa single-handedly. He was part of a long struggle.\n\n2. **Built on sacrifice**: His success was built on the sacrifices, courage, and wisdom of generations of African patriots who fought against oppression.\n\n3. **Collective effort**: The anti-apartheid movement was a collective effort of many brave men and women who risked their lives for freedom.\n\n4. **Humility**: Despite being celebrated as a hero, Mandela remained humble and gave credit to others.\n\n5. **Historical continuity**: He saw himself as continuing the work started by his predecessors, carrying forward their dreams and ideals.\n\n6. **Inspiration**: Those who came before him inspired and shaped his values, courage, and determination.\n\nThis statement shows Mandela\'s greatness - he recognized that leadership is about building on the foundation laid by others, not claiming individual glory.',

    solution_text: '**What is "dust of snow":**\nA "dust of snow" refers to tiny particles of snow that fall from a tree. It\'s a very small amount of snow, light as dust, that the crow shook off from the hemlock tree onto the poet.\n\n**What changed the poet\'s mood:**\nThe simple, natural incident of a crow shaking snow from a hemlock tree onto him changed the poet\'s mood. This small, unexpected moment in nature had a profound impact on him.\n\n**How the mood changed:**\nThe poet was in a sad, depressed, or regretful mood before this incident. He felt he had wasted his day and was filled with negativity. However, when the dust of snow fell on him, it refreshed him and lifted his spirits. This small moment of connection with nature transformed his gloomy mood into a more positive one. It saved the rest of his day from being wasted, giving him a new perspective and renewed energy.\n\nThe poem conveys that small, simple moments in nature can have healing power and can change our entire outlook on life.',

    question_text_english: 'Why was the young seagull afraid to fly? Do you think all young birds are afraid to make their first flight?',
    solution_text: 'The young seagull was afraid to fly for several reasons:\n\n1. **Fear of falling**: When he looked down at the vast sea below, he was terrified that his wings would not support him and he would fall into the water and drown.\n\n2. **Lack of confidence**: He had no faith in his wings. He felt they were too weak to carry his weight.\n\n3. **Great height**: The ledge where he stood was very high above the sea, which made the distance seem enormous and frightening.\n\n4. **First experience**: This was his first attempt at flying. Like any new experience, it filled him with anxiety and uncertainty.\n\nRegarding whether all young birds are afraid:\n\nYes, it is quite natural for young birds to be afraid of their first flight. Just like human children learning to walk or ride a bicycle, young birds experience fear when attempting something for the first time. However, the degree of fear may vary - some might be more adventurous while others more cautious. The young seagull\'s siblings had already flown, suggesting that while fear is common, some overcome it more quickly than others. The instinct to fly is strong, and with encouragement and necessity, most young birds eventually overcome their initial fear.',

    solution_text: 'The young seagull expressed his excitement in several ways when he saw his mother approaching with food:\n\n1. **Loud screaming**: He uttered a joyful scream, expressing his happiness and hunger.\n\n2. **Physical movement**: He leaned out eagerly from the ledge, tapping the rock with his feet.\n\n3. **Trying to reach closer**: He attempted to come nearer to her, showing his eagerness to get the food.\n\n4. **Complete focus**: His entire attention was on the piece of fish in his mother\'s beak.\n\nThis excitement was natural because he had been hungry for a whole day. His family had been trying to encourage him to fly by leaving him without food. The sight of food after such a long wait naturally made him forget his fear temporarily and focus entirely on satisfying his hunger. This strong desire for food ultimately became the motivation that made him take his first flight - when he leaned too far trying to reach the fish, he fell and was forced to use his wings.',

    solution_text: 'Yes, Anne Frank was absolutely right when she said that "paper has more patience than people." Her observation was both profound and practical:\n\n**Why Anne was correct:**\n\n1. **Non-judgmental**: Paper (her diary) would never judge her thoughts, feelings, or actions. People, on the other hand, often judge and criticize.\n\n2. **Always available**: The diary was always there to listen whenever she wanted to express herself. People may not always be available or willing to listen.\n\n3. **Complete confidentiality**: The diary would keep all her secrets safe.

    solution_text_english: 'Yes, Anne Frank was absolutely right when she said that "paper has more patience than people." Her observation was both profound and practical:\n\n**Why Anne was correct:**\n\n1. **Non-judgmental**: Paper (her diary) would never judge her thoughts, feelings, or actions. People, on the other hand, often judge and criticize.\n\n2. **Always available**: The diary was always there to listen whenever she wanted to express herself. People may not always be available or willing to listen.\n\n3. **Complete confidentiality**: The diary would keep all her secrets safe. People might gossip or reveal her private thoughts to others.\n\n4. **Unlimited time**: She could write as much and as long as she wanted.

    question_text_english: 'What is the rhyme scheme of the poem? How does it help in bringing out the contrasting ideas in the poem?',
    solution_text: '**Rhyme Scheme:**\n\nThe rhyme scheme of "Fire and Ice" is: a-b-a-a-b-c-b-c-b\n\nBreakdown:\n- Line 1: "desire" (a)\n- Line 2: "ice" (b)\n- Line 3: "fire" (a)\n- Line 4: "fire" (a)\n- Line 5: "twice" (b)\n- Line 6: "hate" (c)\n- Line 7: "ice" (b)\n- Line 8: "great" (c)\n- Line 9: "suffice" (b)\n\n**How it helps bring out contrasting ideas:**\n\n1. **Interlocking pattern**: The alternating rhyme creates an interlocking effect that mirrors how fire and ice, though opposites, are both equally destructive. They are woven together in the rhyme just as they are connected in the poem\'s theme.\n\n2. **Emphasis on "ice"**: The rhyme "ice" appears three times (lines 2, 7, 9), emphasizing the importance of this destructive force alongside fire.\n\n3. **Compact structure**: The tight rhyme scheme creates a compact, powerful poem that delivers its message efficiently - just as both fire and ice would end the world efficiently.\n\n4. **Balance**: The recurring "b" rhyme (ice, twice, suffice) balances with the "a" rhyme (desire, fire), showing that both forces are equally capable of destruction.\n\n5. **Controlled chaos**: The structured rhyme represents controlled expression of chaotic, destructive emotions (desire and hatred).',

    question_text_english: 'How does the tiger act in the cage? How is it different from the tiger in the jungle?',
    solution_text: '**Tiger in the Cage:**\n\n1. **Stalking in limited space**: The tiger walks in his cage, stalking the length of it with quiet rage.\n\n2. **Ignoring visitors**: He ignores the visitors who come to see him, showing his disinterest and possibly depression.\n\n3. **Silent anger**: His rage is "quiet" - he is angry but helpless, unable to express it.\n\n4. **Pacing back and forth**: He moves in a repetitive pattern within his confined space, showing frustration.\n\n5. **Looking at stars**: At night, he stares at the stars, perhaps longing for freedom.\n\n6. **Locked behind bars**: He is imprisoned, his strength and power useless.\n\n**Tiger in the Jungle (Natural Habitat):**\n\n1. **Free movement**: He would be lurking in shadow, sliding through long grass near a water hole.\n\n2. **Hunting**: He would be terrorizing the village, displaying his power and hunting for prey.\n\n3. **Powerful presence**: His teeth would be bared, claws would be sharp and ready, showing his natural predatory nature.\n\n4. **Fearsome**: Villagers would be afraid of him, recognizing his strength and danger.\n\n5. **Active and purposeful**: Every movement would have purpose - hunting, protecting territory, or seeking mates.\n\n**Contrast:**\nThe caged tiger is a shadow of his natural self - from a mighty predator to a helpless prisoner, from freedom to confinement, from purposeful hunting to meaningless pacing. The poem powerfully conveys how captivity destroys the tiger\'s natural spirit and dignity.',
