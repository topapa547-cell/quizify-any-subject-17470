    question_text_english: 'What did Lencho hope for?',
    solution_text: 'Lencho hoped for a good rain or at least a shower to water his fields of corn. He was a hardworking farmer who depended entirely on the harvest for his family\'s survival. The rain was essential for his crops, and he had been waiting anxiously for it. His fields needed water desperately, and he believed that a good rain would ensure a good harvest, which would help him feed his family and pay his debts.',

    question_text_english: 'Why did Lencho say the raindrops were like \'new coins\'?',
    solution_text: 'Lencho compared the raindrops to "new coins" because he saw them as a blessing that would bring him prosperity. As a farmer, rain meant that his crops would grow well, leading to a good harvest. A good harvest would bring him money when he sold his produce. Thus, the raindrops were as valuable as money to him. Each drop represented hope and the promise of financial security for his family. This metaphor beautifully captures how dependent farmers are on nature for their livelihood.',

    question_text_english: 'How did the rain change? What happened to Lencho\'s fields?',
    solution_text: 'The rain that Lencho had eagerly awaited suddenly changed into a hailstorm. What started as gentle raindrops turned into large hailstones that fell like frozen pearls. For an hour, the hail rained on the house, the garden, the hillside, and the cornfield. The hailstorm was devastating - it destroyed everything. The corn was completely ruined, the flowers were gone from the plants, and the trees were stripped bare. Not a single leaf remained on the trees. Lencho\'s fields, which had promised a good harvest, were completely destroyed, leaving the family facing starvation and ruin.',

    question_text_english: 'What were Lencho\'s feelings when the hail stopped?',
    solution_text: 'When the hail stopped, Lencho was filled with sadness and despair. His soul was filled with sorrow as he looked at his ruined fields. He saw that his entire year\'s labor and hopes had been destroyed in just one hour. The corn that would have fed his family was gone. He was worried about his family\'s future - they would have no food to eat for the coming year. Despite this devastation, Lencho maintained his faith in God. He believed that God sees everything and would help them in their hour of need. This shows his deep religious faith and optimism even in the face of complete disaster.',

    question_text_english: 'Who or what did Lencho have faith in? What did he do?',
    solution_text: 'Lencho had unshakeable faith in God. He believed that God was all-knowing, all-seeing, and would never abandon those who truly believed in Him. Even after losing everything in the hailstorm, his faith remained strong.\n\nLencho decided to write a letter to God, asking for help. In the letter, he explained his situation - how the hailstorm had destroyed his fields and how his family would starve without money to buy food and seeds for replanting. He asked God to send him one hundred pesos to help him survive until the next harvest. He addressed the letter simply "To God" and put it in the mailbox, confident that it would reach its destination. This shows his simple, childlike faith and his belief that God would directly help him.',

    solution_text: 'The postman found the letter addressed "To God" and was amused. He showed it to the postmaster, who read it and was deeply moved by Lencho\'s faith in God. The postmaster didn\'t want to shake this man\'s faith, so he decided to help.\n\nHe made a generous decision - he would answer the letter. However, he realized he couldn\'t send the full hundred pesos that Lencho had requested. So he called his employees and friends, explained the situation, and asked them to contribute. He himself gave part of his salary. Together, they collected seventy pesos. The postmaster put this money in an envelope addressed to Lencho and signed it simply "God" to maintain Lencho\'s faith. This act showed the postmaster\'s kindness, empathy, and understanding of the importance of faith in a person\'s life.',

    solution_text: 'No, Lencho was not at all surprised to find the letter with money. This was because he had complete and unwavering faith in God. He had written the letter with such confidence that he never doubted for a moment that God would respond to his request. His faith was so strong that he expected God to send him the money he had asked for.\n\nIn fact, Lencho showed no surprise whatsoever when he received the letter. He had been so certain of God\'s help that he was actually expecting the reply. However, when he opened the envelope and counted the money, he became angry because there were only seventy pesos instead of the hundred he had requested. His faith was so simple and literal that he couldn\'t imagine God making a mistake - so he assumed the post office employees must have stolen the missing thirty pesos.',

He called them "a bunch of crooks" in his second letter to God. This reaction shows the irony of the situation - the very people who helped him out of kindness were now being accused of theft. Lencho\'s simple faith couldn\'t comprehend that these people had actually been his benefactors, not thieves.',

He was part of a long struggle.\n\n2. **Built on sacrifice**: His success was built on the sacrifices, courage, and wisdom of generations of African patriots who fought against oppression.\n\n3. **Collective effort**: The anti-apartheid movement was a collective effort of many brave men and women who risked their lives for freedom.\n\n4. **Humility**: Despite being celebrated as a hero, Mandela remained humble and gave credit to others.\n\n5. **Historical continuity**: He saw himself as continuing the work started by his predecessors, carrying forward their dreams and ideals.\n\n6. **Inspiration**: Those who came before him inspired and shaped his values, courage, and determination.\n\nThis statement shows Mandela\'s greatness - he recognized that leadership is about building on the foundation laid by others, not claiming individual glory.',

    solution_text: '**What is "dust of snow":**\nA "dust of snow" refers to tiny particles of snow that fall from a tree. It\'s a very small amount of snow, light as dust, that the crow shook off from the hemlock tree onto the poet.\n\n**What changed the poet\'s mood:**\nThe simple, natural incident of a crow shaking snow from a hemlock tree onto him changed the poet\'s mood.

He felt he had wasted his day and was filled with negativity. However, when the dust of snow fell on him, it refreshed him and lifted his spirits.

It saved the rest of his day from being wasted, giving him a new perspective and renewed energy.\n\nThe poem conveys that small, simple moments in nature can have healing power and can change our entire outlook on life.',
