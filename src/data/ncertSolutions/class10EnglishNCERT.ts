    solution_text: 'Lencho hoped for a good harvest from his cornfield. He was a hardworking farmer who had complete faith in God. He had sown corn in his field and was eagerly waiting for rain to get a good crop. When dark clouds appeared in the sky, he was filled with hope and happiness, as he knew rain would bring prosperity to his family. His entire livelihood depended on the success of his harvest, and he had high expectations for a bountiful yield that year.',

    question_text_english: 'Why did Lencho say the raindrops were like "new coins"?',
    solution_text: 'Lencho compared the raindrops to "new coins" because he knew that rain was essential for his crops to grow well. For a farmer like Lencho, rain meant a good harvest, which would bring him money when he sold the produce. The raindrops falling on his field were like precious coins falling from heaven because they would lead to prosperity and financial security for his family.\n\nEach raindrop represented hope and promise of wealth. Just as new coins are shiny, valuable, and bring joy, the raindrops brought happiness and the assurance of a successful harvest. This metaphor beautifully captures Lencho\'s optimistic perspective and his deep understanding of the direct connection between rainfall and his economic well-being.',

    question_text_english: 'How did the rain change? What happened to Lencho\'s fields?',
    solution_text: 'The rain that initially brought joy to Lencho soon turned into a devastating hailstorm. What started as gentle, beneficial rainfall suddenly transformed into large hailstones falling from the sky. The change was dramatic and destructive.\n\nThe hailstorm lasted for an hour and completely destroyed Lencho\'s cornfield. The hailstones were so large and violent that they:\n\n1. Destroyed the flowers from the plants\n2. Broke down the corn stalks\n3. Stripped the leaves from the trees\n4. Left the field looking like it was covered with salt (white hailstones)\n\nAfter the hailstorm passed, not a single leaf remained on the trees, and the corn was completely ruined. Lencho\'s hopes for a good harvest were shattered. The field that had promised prosperity just moments before was now completely devastated. There was nothing left that could be harvested, leading to total crop failure and financial ruin for Lencho and his family.',

    question_text_english: 'What did being free mean to Mandela as a boy, and as a student? How does he contrast these "transitory freedoms" with "the basic and honourable freedoms"?',
    solution_text: 'For young Mandela, freedom had different meanings at different stages of life:\n\nAs a Boy:\nFreedom meant simple, personal liberties like running in the fields, swimming in streams, roasting mealies (corn) under the stars, and riding the broad backs of slow-moving bulls. These were physical freedoms that allowed him to enjoy his childhood without restrictions.\n\nAs a Student:\nFreedom meant the ability to stay out at night, read what he pleased, and go where he chose. These were individual freedoms of choice and movement.\n\nContrast with Basic Freedoms:\n\nMandela calls these early freedoms "transitory" (temporary/superficial) because:\n1. They were limited to personal pleasures and individual choices\n2. They didn\'t address the fundamental oppression of his people\n3. They were illusions in a society where his people had no real rights\n\nThe "basic and honourable freedoms" he later fought for were:\n1. Freedom to achieve one\'s potential\n2. Freedom to earn a living\n3. Freedom to marry and have a family\n4. Freedom to live a lawful life with dignity\n5. Political freedom and equality for all\n\nMandela realized that his personal freedoms were meaningless when his people were not free. True freedom required the liberation of all South Africans from apartheid and oppression.',

    solution_text: 'Mandela\'s understanding of freedom underwent a profound transformation as he matured:\n\nChildhood Understanding:\n- Freedom was purely personal and physical\n- Running, playing, swimming without restrictions\n- Freedom of movement in his immediate surroundings\n- Innocent, self-centered view of liberty\n\nYouth/Student Phase:\n- Freedom meant personal choices (staying out, reading, traveling)\n- Still focused on individual liberties\n- Beginning to question but not yet fully aware\n\nGrowing Awareness:\n- Realized his "freedom" was an illusion under apartheid\n- Understood that without his people\'s freedom, his own was curtailed\n- Recognized the systematic oppression of black South Africans\n\nMature Understanding:\n- Freedom became about dignity, equality, and human rights\n- Shifted from "freedom for me" to "freedom for all"\n- Understood freedom as:\n  * Economic opportunity\n  * Political rights\n  * Social equality\n  * Human dignity\n  * Justice for all\n\nRevolutionary Perspective:\n- Realized that achieving true freedom required sacrifice\n- Understood the oppressor must also be freed (from hatred and oppression)\n- Recognized freedom as both a right and a responsibility\n\nThis evolution shows how Mandela transformed from a boy seeking personal pleasures to a leader fighting for universal human rights and dignity.',

    question_text_english: 'Why was the young seagull afraid to fly? Do you think all young birds are afraid to make their first flight?',
    solution_text: 'The young seagull was afraid to fly for several reasons:\n\n1. Fear of Falling:\n- He was terrified that his wings would not support him\n- The sea below seemed vast and dangerous\n- He feared he would fall into the water and drown\n\n2. Lack of Confidence:\n- He doubted his own abilities despite seeing his siblings fly successfully\n- His wings felt weak and inadequate to him\n- He had no previous experience to build confidence\n\n3. The Great Expanse:\n- The distance from the ledge to the sea seemed enormous\n- The vastness of the sky was intimidating\n- The height made him dizzy with fear\n\nDo all young birds fear their first flight?\n\nYes, it is natural for young birds to have some fear during their first flight because:\n\n1. Instinctive Caution: Fear is a protective mechanism that prevents reckless behavior\n\n2. New Experience: Any first-time experience, especially one involving risk, naturally causes anxiety\n\n3. Physical Challenge: Flying requires coordination and strength that young birds are using for the first time\n\n4. Survival Instinct: Fear helps birds assess risks before taking dangerous actions\n\nHowever, with encouragement, hunger, or necessity, young birds overcome this natural fear, just as the seagull did when driven by hunger. The fear is temporary and part of the learning process.',
